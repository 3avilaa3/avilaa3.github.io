  <td style="font-size: 18px;"width="85%">"This article outlines many types of scams that target people in Australia as well as around the world. These include text, phone, email, and social media scams, where fraudsters pretend to be trusted sources like family, businesses, or government bodies to deceive victims. Romance scams manipulate emotions to steal money, while investment scams promise high returns on fake opportunities. Product and service scams target consumers, offering counterfeit goods or services, and threat/extortion scams involve blackmail or hijacking devices. Job and employment scams lure victims with fake job offers requiring upfront payments. Unexpected money scams promise prizes from non-existent lotteries or competitions. Lastly, impersonation scams involve fraudsters pretending to be trusted entities to steal money or personal information. Victims are warned to stay alert and report suspicious activity."</td>

  <td style="font-size: 18px;"width="85%">"Cybercrime has become an increasingly expensive issue, with costs passing $1 trillion since 2018. This includes both the financial losses from cybercrime, estimated at $945 billion, and the $145 billion spent on cybersecurity annually. The US Department of Justice says the cost of cybercrime will most likely double by 2021. Small businesses may be the most impacted since they are not able to pay for damages, while large corporations often pay millions in damages. The average cost of a data breach is around $3.5 million. In Canada, people reported losing $61 million to scams in 2015, total losses are estimated to be $1.2 billion. Online attacks are increasing, with 56% of Canadians experiencing malware or virus attacks. Despite these risks, many Canadians engage in risky online behaviors, such as reusing passwords. Cybercrime is a significant part of the underground economy, with economic and personal dangers, and growing, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic."</td>
