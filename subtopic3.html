  <td style="font-size: 18px;"width="85%">"Spoofing and phishing are common cybercrime methods aimed at stealing personal information. Spoofing involves changing communication, such as emails or phone numbers, to appear as if they're from trusted sources like banks or family members. The goal is to trick victims into giving sensitive data or downloading malicious software. Phishing scams often use spoofing techniques to lure people into providing personal information by faking legitimate requests. These scams may involve emails asking for account updates, directing victims to fake websites to steal login information. Phishing can also happen through phone (vishing), text messages (smishing), or malicious redirects (pharming). To protect against these threats, the article suggests we should verify suspicious communications, avoid clicking on unverified links, and use multi-factor authentication. The FBI advises reporting incidents to the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) for investigation."</td>

  <td style="font-size: 18px;"width="85%">"This Cornell Law Wex article on computer and internet fraud defines it as criminal activity involving the illegal use of computers or the internet. This includes things like hacking, identity theft, and phishing. The primary law addressing this is the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), which prohibits unauthorized access to protected computers, and other offenses. Examples of internet fraud include phishing emails, installing malware to mine data, fraudulently accessing personal information, and spreading viruses. People who do so can face prosecution under various laws, including those related to fraud, wire, and communication crimes. The article emphasizes the legal consequences and the importance of protecting online data."</td>
