  <td style="font-size: 18px;"width="85%">"The person committing fraud (scammer) is conscious of the deception or any adjustments to the information being sent to the victim ("mark"). Fraud (or scam) is the commitment of cunning acts to acquire illicit profit over an individual or organization. Two merchants from Greece recorded the first evidence of fraud around 400 years BC. Some of the most common fraud types are phishing, bank fraud, account takeover, identity fraud, COVID-19 fraud, cyber fraud, and Ponzi fraud. Fraud has evolved from identity fraud to insurance, property, product, and cyber and credit fraud. Fraudsters/scammers can act as minor as stealing people's information and identities to actions as significant as organizations' staggering debt or benefitting from tragic events like COVID-19. There are preventative measures to ensure individuals don't fall for these tricksters, such as eCommerce, basic data matching systems, and authenticators."</td>

  <td style="font-size: 18px;"width="85%">"The article from the Harvard Gazette discusses the rising threat of online scams and the psychological tactics scammers use to trick people into giving up their money. Bruce Schneier, a cybersecurity expert at Harvard, explains that scams can affect anyone, regardless of their intelligence or background. He emphasizes that while scammers' methods have evolved with technology, the core principles remain the same—targeting people's emotions to gain trust. Schneier also points out that the scale of online scams has increased due to technology, with scammers reaching millions of potential victims. Cryptocurrency, which allows untraceable and instantaneous transactions, has made scams more difficult to prevent. He also highlights the role of social media companies, which profit from fake ads and have little incentive to screen them. Schneier calls for more regulation, especially around cryptocurrency, and expresses doubt about the effectiveness of government regulations to prevent scams."</td>
